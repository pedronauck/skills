# XState Store

Targets `@xstate/store` v4 and `@xstate/store-react` v2 (TypeScript 5.4+). Read the reference matched by the API or behavior being changed. Load adjacent references only for concerns the change crosses; reuse relevant context already read.

## Pick the primitive first

| State | Primitive | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Domain state updated through named events | `createStore({ context, on })` | Typed `trigger`, `can`, emitted events, replayable transitions |
| Per-instance state built from input | `createStoreLogic({ context: (input) => … })` | One definition, many instances; `selectors` come along |
| A single value set directly | `createAtom(value)` | No event vocabulary to justify a store |
| A value computed from other atoms or selectors | `createAtom(() => …)` | Read-only, recomputes on dependency change |
| Modes, guards, delays, hierarchical or parallel states | `xstate` machine | A store models data, not lifecycle |

*Done when:* the primitive is chosen from this table and its justification holds.

Apply the technical rules relevant to the changed behavior.

## Tripwires

**Transitions** — return the complete next context (spread the old one); return `undefined` to mark an event disallowed, which is what `store.can.*()` reports.

**Effects** — call `enqueue.effect`, `enqueue.emit.*`, and `enqueue.trigger.*` synchronously inside the transition; async work goes inside `enqueue.effect(async () => …)` and reports back by triggering another event.

**Imports** — framework bindings come from `@xstate/store-react` (and siblings), never `@xstate/store/react`; extensions come from `@xstate/store/persist`, `/undo`, `/reset`, `/validate`.

**Schemas** — `schemas` types the store; only `.with(validateSchemas())` validates at runtime.

**Atoms** — computed atoms read dependencies via `.get()`; their first parameter is the previous computed value, so annotate `createAtom<T>(…)` when using it.

**React** — module-scoped stores for app-wide state, `useStore(logic, input)` for component-scoped state; subscribe through `useSelector`/`useAtom` rather than `getSnapshot()`.
